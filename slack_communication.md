### Slack communication

Slack is our primary communication tool for client projects and company related stuff. We should aim to use it efficiently and for communication that's happening there to be clean.
Here are some rules we would like to follow when communicating over Slack:

- (Notification channel will be created soon) All important and company-wide information are posted on #notifications. Respond only in threads on this channel. - *Mateusz C please update with correct channel name *
- Private announcements/questions/jokes should be posted on #random, please keep them out of work related channels.
- When discussing project related matters, try to keep discussion open for all members - try to always use project channel and avoid chatting in private messages.
- Project team members are responsible for project channel they belong to. They should watch and ensure our communication standards are preserved on those channels. They should also monitor list of people who have access to project channel and act if someone should be removed.
- Async communication is async - Keep in mind that even though Slack messages are instant, not everyone will read your message immediately. Give others enough time to react and process what you've sent and don't bother them with unnecessary mentions in your message.
- Slack notifications are interruptive and we should manage them wisely
  - You can mute or leave channels you don't have to actively listen to.
  - Try not to overuse @channel and @here mentions. Before using them try to evaluate if really every channel member should get your message and if it's required to read it asap.
  - We treat private messages as a top priority, they should be used for more important matters and we should respond to them with higher priority.

- Instead of sending multiple messages in a row try to think a bit more about what exactly you want to communicate and if it can be contained it in a single message. Don't flood your coworkers with notifications.
- We all have our beliefs and opinions, we don't want them to bring bad atmosphere to our company. Please avoid discussing political/religious matters in public channels.
