# Online communication guideline

By nature our work requires a lot of communication. Project specific information as well as more general talk is often taking place online using specific tools such as Slack app.

Some common rules should be incorporated by people for this communication to stay clean and effective.

- Typically there are some channels designed for general, company-wide announcements. Keep in mind these are mainly read-only threads and try to keep them that way
- In the same fashion there are channels for some loose, after hours discussion provided
- Project related issues are visible the most when posted on project channels. This way all of the team members have equal access to the information, using private messages can often lead to information misalignment inside the team
- As a part of a team you are all responsible for keeping high standard of the conversation. You also need to manage people that belong to project channel.
- It might be the case sometimes that you will not get an immediate response to your message. People have different responsibilities during the day, but eventually you will get the answer. This is more obvious when people are in different timezones.
- Generally it is better to think twice before posting. Thinking about one consistent message a little longer may prevent notifying other people multiple times for the same reason.

### Some useful tips when using online communicators:

- There is a Do not disturb mode available in slack. Donâ€™t worry, you will not miss out on anything. You can easily turn it on by typing e.g. /dnd 14 minutes in any chat
- Limiting active channels will help you focus. Less important ones can be muted as well
- Commands like `@here` or `@channel` are very useful. Be sure to check it out in the docs. However use them wisely. Think about the importance of your message and the other team members. Maybe this is not what you have to use this time.
- If someone decides to write a private message it is probably something important and they would love to know that you have got it. If possible try to always get back to people as soon as possible, even to confirm and schedule a wider discussion later on.

### Channel naming convention

- `htd-...` (example: htd-general) --> Channels for discussion that every employee could be interested in. You should follow all channels from this group and every new employee should be invited to those channels by onboarding team
- `[project]-...` (example: nutrimedy-general) --> Channels for specific client project. All employees that have active participation in a given project should follow its dedicated channel
- `ev-...` (example: ev-reason-workshops-2019) --> Channels to discuss events related stuff. Preparation and organization for workshops/conferences/company trips
- `learn-...` (example: learn-javascript) --> Channels dedicated to share knowledge and help in learning specific technologies/languagues
- `task-...` (example: task-code-review-guidelines) --> Channels dedicated to manage process and discussion around specific task. Those channels should be archived after task group has completed its work
- `ext-...` (example: ext-projekt-inno) --> Channels where we invite guests with access to only one channel
- `ama-...` (example: `ama-toggl`) --> Questions & answers about specific company area (administration, education budget etc.)
