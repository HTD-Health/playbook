## Home for HTD knowledge database

This folder serves as a collaborative and curated list of learning materials that we consider valuable.

## List of content

- [General programming](./programming.md)

## Contributing guideline

Anyone is free to add interesting materials he/she discovered, but please follow these 3 steps while adding any new content :)

1. Before adding any new content make sure it doesn't exist in any list already. Github search might be helpful with this
2. Find suitable category for material you want to add
3. Issue a PR with content you would like to add. Try to keep a single PR focused on a single topic
