## The Convention

We have outlined a convention that would be good to stick with adding new items in the knowledge base.

1. You should always add a position to the appropriate category in the database. If this category does not exist, you should create it.
2. Each item should be properly formatted and described. Example:
  ```
  - [[WWW] Nest - A progressive Node.js framework for building efficient, reliable and scalable server-side applications.](https://nestjs.com/)
  ```
3. You should always add the appropriate label to the item. This is to make it easier for others to get acquainted with the material you have made available. All available labels here:
- `WWW`
- `Video`
- `Article`
- `Github`
- `Course`
- `Game`
    ##### TIP: (If you can't describe your position with any of the above labels, please open PR With your proposal for a new label)


## Contributing guideline

Anyone is free to add interesting materials he/she discovered, but please follow these 3 steps while adding any new content :)

1. Before adding any new content make sure it doesn't exist in any list already. Github search might be helpful with this
2. Find suitable category for material you want to add
3. Issue a PR with content you would like to add. Try to keep a single PR focused on a single topic
