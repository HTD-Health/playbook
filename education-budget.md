# Education budget

Starting January 1, 2019, we are introducing a yearly education budget for each person. 
We want to be more transparent and we believe that having the coherent rules regarding extra learning opportunities will help.

## What is the amount of education budget?
The amount depends on the number of hours a person works per week. A full-time employee (40 hours per week on average) gets 3 000 PLN education budget. If you work less hours then your budget will be proportionally smaller e.g. a half-time (20 hours per week on average) employee gets 1 500 PLN. Similarly, the amount will be proportional to a number of months your work in a given year e.g. if you join HTD on July 1, 2019 then your education budget will be 1 500 PLN in 2019 and 3 000 PLN in 2020 and later.

## Is everyone eligible for the education budget?
The education budget applies to all the employees, regardless of the type of contract. Therefore no matter whether you have a B2B contract, Umowa Zlecenie or Umowa o Pracę you have an education budget.

## How does the education budget affect my taxes?
The money you spent from your education budget will be taxed as your revenue so your tax base will be higher. The tax office (Urząd Skarbowy) will treat the amount spent as if you received extra cash revenue.

## What you can spend the money on
The budget can be spent both on software design and development related things including, but not limited to:
- books
- online courses, including online university courses like Coursera, edX etc.
- conferences including tickets, travel, gas, hotel, food.
- paid Meetups and events
- post-graduate studies
- onsite and online training, including trainings required to pass certain certification exams
- certification/exam fees e.g. Product Owner, Scrum Master, AWS and other certifications. AWS exams taken until February 1, 2019 will be paid from the company-wide budget and as such will not decrease your education budget.
- English lessons (more on this further down)

## What if I want to buy something that is not listed above?
If your expense is not listed above please ask Maciek Z. We want to keep the rules quite relaxed and reasonable e.g. a book on psychology would still fall under the budget if it helps undersntad digital apps users behavior.

## How does the education budget affect our English lessons held in the office?
Starting January 1, English lessongs will be paid from employees education budget. The 2019 rate of 30 min English conversation with our English teacher will be known in December, 2018.

## What kind of expenses are excluded?
- BSc and MSc programmes are excluded
- any hardware. However, if you have an idea for a hardware that is helpful, please reach out to Maciek Z and we will consider buying it from the company-wide budget.

## Will HTD still pay for shared online courses from the company budget?
Yes. HTD will continue paying for online courses that we consider basic and as such will be e.g. a part of our onboarding. 
If you think that a given online course would benefit a larger group of people please do reach out to Maciek Z and we will consider funding it from the company-wide budget.

## I found a conference/book/whatever that I want to buy from my education budget. How will I pay for it?
Our will is to order Revolut physical prepaid business cards for all the employees and then hand it out to each employee in December 2018 and they will keep it at home. If we go that route then you will simply be able to use the card both online and at physical locations.
Please note that we are not yet sure if Revolut Business will work for us so we might go different route. 

## What if I want to attend a training that costs 3500 + VAT? Can I use my budget for that?
Yes, you can. You can use whatever chunk of your budget to fund such a training e.g. you can take 2 000 PLN from you education budget and pay the rest (1 500) from your personal money.

## Is VAT tax included in the amount?
The budget is reduced by a net amount (i.e. without VAT tax) of your expense if you provide an expense invoice to us and the invoice lists "HTD Polska sp. z o.o." as a buyer. If you are not able to provide an invoice then your budget will be reduced by the brutto amount (i.e. including VAT).

For instance, if a conference costs 1230 PLN (1000 net + 230 PLN VAT) if you provide an invoice then we treat it as the cost was 1000 PLN so your education budget is decreased by 1000 PLN. 

## How do I request an invoice?
When you buy online you should fill a "Faktura VAT" form online one a seller website and put the following company data:

HTD Polska sp. z o.o.
NIP 9471997285
ul. Brukowa 12/18
91-342 Łódź

(Yes, put 91-342 as a zipcode)

## Will I be paid for going to a conference or attending a training of my choice?
When you you go to a conference or a training of your choice we ask you to take an unpaid day(s) off i.e. unless instructed otherwise, do not log the time spent on a conference on any client or internal project. Specifically:
- do not log hours in Toggl
- request an unpaid day off in Calamari

## Should I notify a client about my absence?
You should proceed exactly the same as in case of taking any other paid or unpaid day off.

## I buy a conference ticket in December, 2020 and the conference takes place in January, 2021. What education budget year is used then?
The day when you pay is taken into account so in the listed case the money will be taken from your 2020 education budget.

## What happens if I don't spend my whole education budget until December 31?
No matter how much of your education budget is spent in a previous year, on January 1 you always start with 3 000 PLN.

## Any other rules?
Please be reasonable and use the budget as if it was your own money.
