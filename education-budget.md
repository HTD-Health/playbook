# Education budget
Starting January 1, 2019, we are introducing a yearly education budget for each person. We want to be more transparent and we believe that having the coherent rules regarding extra learning opportunities will help.
### What is the amount of a yearly education budget?
It is 5 000 PLN education budget in 2020. In 2019 the education budget was 4 000 PLN.
### Is everyone eligible for the education budget?
The education budget applies to all the employees, regardless of the type of contract. Therefore no matter whether you have a B2B contract, Umowa Zlecenie or Umowa o Pracę you have an education budget.
### What if I don't work full-time?
We've made some updates to the policy in June 2020. If you work fewer hours than full time, your budget is still 5 000 PLN in 2020.
### What if I've started my work at HTD in 2020? Do I still can use 5 000 PLN from EB?
Depending on when you started working, you have a proportional amount to use. For example, starting in July 2020, you have PLN 2,500 to use.
### What happens if I don't use everything in 2020?
The unused amount from the education budget is carried over to the next year. There is no limit to your budget accumulating from year to year.
### Will the amount change in the future?
Our will is to significantly increase the education budget in the future. If the "education budget" initiative proves to be a sound idea then increasing the amount will be a priority as the company grows.
### What you can spend the money on
The budget can be spent both on software design and development related things including, but not limited to:

- books
- online courses, including online university courses like Coursera, edX etc.
- conferences including conference tickets, travel expenses (train and airline tickets, etc.), hotel. **Food/meals are excluded and should be paid for with you personal money.paid Meetups and events**
- post-graduate studies, if they are related to your fields of expertise at HTD Health
- onsite and online training, including trainings required to pass certain certification exams
- certification/exam fees e.g. Product Owner, Scrum Master, AWS and other certifications. AWS exams taken until February 1, 2019 will be paid from the company-wide - budget and as such will not decrease your education budget.
- English lessons (more on this further down)

### How does the education budget affect my extramural studies?
Yours extramural studies are not affecting your education budget. Moreover, you can use an extra budget (independent of the education budget) for financing your extramural studies. Details:

- the extramural studies budget is 5000 PLN for the semester
- it can be used in the academic year 2020/2021
- your studies must be related to your fields of expertise at HTD Health

For more detailed information, please contact <accounting@htdevelopers.com>

### What if I want to buy something that is not listed above?
If your expense is not listed above please write an email to <edubudget@htdevelopers.com>. We want to keep the rules quite relaxed and reasonable e.g. a book on psychology would still fall under the budget if it helps understand digital apps users behavior.
### How does the education budget affect our English lessons held in the office?
English lessons held in the office does not affect your education budget.
###  Can I take some different English course of my choice?
You are welcome to attend different english course of your choice or take private conversations outside of the office and pay for it fully or partially out of your education budget. Please note that you will still need to provide an invoice.
### What kind of expenses are excluded from the education budget?

- BSc and MSc programmes are excluded
- hardware related to daily work (mouse, trackpad etc.) - Such things are bought by the company and delivered to you. You are welcome to buy hardware related to your education & growth e.g. Arduino, Raspberry Pi. If you have an idea for another hardware and are not sure whether it is supported by the education budget then please write an email to <edubudget@htdevelopers.com>
- meals. You can however book a room with breakfast included and then effectively the breakfast meal will be paid from your education budget

### Hotel, tickets, meals... it’s all too complicated. Please give me a real world example.
Imagine you buy a ticket to Meet.js conference in Poznań, go there with your own car and book a hotel room with breakfast included. While staying there you also buy a lunch at the conference venue and a dinner at the hotel.
Out of all the aforementioned expenses, the following ones can be paid out of your education budget:

- conference ticket
- Gas (UoP, UZ - kilometrówka, B2B - add to your invoice for HTD)
- hotel room with breakfast included

### Will HTD still pay for shared online courses from the company budget?
Yes. HTD will continue paying for online courses that we consider basic and as such will be e.g. a part of our onboarding. If you think that a given online course would benefit a larger group of people please write an email to <edubudget@htdevelopers.com> and we will consider funding it from the company-wide budget.
### Will HTD still be buying physical books from the company budget?
Yes. If you think that a given book will benefit a larger group of people please add a comment to [HTD Bookshelf | Requests tab](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/160JGrusqDqLwSK20DL9AuPQ12yMkVujK_qfkER8Ay2k/edit#gid=1603685952) mention Maciek Ż. and Ania G. in your comment and we will consider funding it from the company-wide budget.
### I found a conference/book/whatever that I want to buy from my education budget. How will I pay for it?
We have ordered Revolut physical debit business cards for all the employees since December 2018. It’s able to use the card both online and at physical locations. Please note that we are not yet sure if Revolut Business will work for us so we might go different route.
### What if I want to attend a training that costs 4 500 + VAT? Can I use my budget for that?
Yes, you can. You can use whatever chunk of your budget to fund such a training e.g. you can take 2 000 PLN from your education budget and pay the rest (2 500) from your personal money.
### Is VAT tax included in the amount?
The budget is reduced by a net amount (i.e. without VAT tax) of your expense. Upload an expense VAT invoice to Revolut Business app with correct data.
For instance, if you pay 1230 PLN (1000 net + 230 PLN VAT) for a conference then we treat it as the cost was 1000 PLN so your education budget is decreased by 1000 PLN. 
### How do I request an invoice from a seller e.g. from a conference organizer?
When you buy online you should fill a "Faktura VAT", "Billing details, "Company name", "Receipt details" or a similar text field in a online form on a seller website and put the following company data:
HTD Polska sp. z o.o.
ul. Brukowa 12
91-341 Łódź
You should also be able to request an invoice by emailing a seller.
### Who do I provide an invoice to? [!]
Please upload an **electronic invoice (.pdf)** to your Revolut Business App.
 
Important: If you have a **paper invoice** or **paragon** then please scan it to pdf and then upload it (one of the apps you can use to scan documents into pdf format is Dropbox, Adobe Scan, Scannable). **Then send** a paper invoice or paragon (both on original paper) to the office address or put it in a mailbox located in the office.

### What if I need to make a transfer?
If you need to make a transfer please contact email <edubudget@htdevelopers.com> and describe your request.
### Should I report that I bought anything using my education budget?
Yes. Add an entry to [Education budgets - expenses](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1XlvjsojU_ycK8KjpJ9c1Q5G3EknapTb_s17P8wvjtK4/edit#gid=0) as soon as you buy anything.
The entire process is described in [this document](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Uz8_eKenQng0WRUwcBuJ6xwvfRTCxcNp/view) 
### Will I be paid for going to a conference or attending a training of my choice?
When you go to a conference or a training of your choice we ask you to take an unpaid day(s) off i.e. unless instructed otherwise, do not log the time spent on a conference on any client or internal project. Specifically:

- do not log hours in Toggl
- request an unpaid/paid day off in Calamari

### Should I notify a client about my absence?
You should proceed exactly the same as in case of taking any other paid or unpaid day off.
### I buy a conference ticket in December, 2020 and the conference takes place in January, 2021. What education budget year is used then?
The day when you pay is taken into account so in the listed case the money will be taken from your 2020 education budget.
### Can I use my education budget to buy an online course for my close friend?
No. The education budget can be used only for the things that are used personally by you e.g. you attending the conference, you reading the book, you attending the training, you watching the online course etc.
If you do otherwise it will be a reason of terminating your contract immediately.
### Should I be reasonable when spending money from my education budget?
Please be reasonable and use the budget as if it was your own money. The education budget is simply a part of revenue that the whole team generates. In other words, the education budgets are our working time. Time is priceless.
### Can I still use Education Budget during the period of notice ?
During the period of notice Education Budget is unavailable.
### Anything else?
If you have any question feel free to write an email to edubudget@htdevelopers.com or post it on a public #ama-edu-budget channel.
