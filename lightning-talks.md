## Where can I find useful information?

All needed information you can find in excel sheet: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1rVuSYv6Ge-e0VF6qheJBMdyLS0O2q3MksTTw8vsrBkU/edit#gid=0

There are two sheets: Lightning Talks Schedule and Lightning Talks ideas.
In Schedule we are writing confirmed information such as date, time and champion.
In Ideas you can write suggestions of topics that you want to present or just topic that you want to hear about without specific champion.

In addition to this document all information will be announced on Slack channel #lightning-talks.
Furthermore, you will receive an invitation to the event in Google Calendar in advance, so that you can plan your time.

## How can I organize LT?

If you’re sure what topic you want to present, fill those information in Schedule next to the date that interest you.
Important!! After picking a date, write on Slack channel #lightning-talks that you pick it and tag one of responsible people (Patryk, Olek, Patrycja).
This information will let us begin the next steps such as conference room reservation and contacting with you personally.

## What if I pick a date but I won’t manage to organize LT?

As soon as you know, you won’t be able to prepare for the LT, let know Patryk, Olek or Patrycja. They will try to change the date or switch places with somebody else.
Remember! It’s your responsibility to inform us in advance.
