# Organization's Definition of Quality
As an organization we share a common sense of what makes a good product development practise. Let it serve as a set of general principles and the basis of the Definition of Done.

### High Standard
- By the constant desire of self-improvement we stay up to date with tooling and techniques
- The quality of work is an ultimate way to fulfill the Definition of Done, it is never compromised by the quantity or time saving
- With that in mind to simplify and optimize the work is cruicial in decision making process

### Quality Assurance
- Quality assurance is the effect of a collaborative work and the fundament of our confidence
- We ensure it by sufficiently describing the goals and requirements with the knowladge we gain throughtout the development process
- Technical Debt is better than not done work. Deliberately used, it is honoured in appropriate time or optimized as a part of constant improvement

### Team Value 
- We always deliver as a team, yet as a group of individuals we share our best expertise and experience with each other to accomplish common goals
- Human interaction is the fillar of the teamwork along with transparency and respect. Pairing techniques and group responsibility leads to to better self-organization
- In the same manner we account for the bugs and failures collectively
