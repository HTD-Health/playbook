## How to request new book?

As of January 2019 we have personal education budgets in form of revolut cards. Shopping for books of personal interest can be done on your own. However it might be good to check if a book you want to buy is already in our library.

If you find that there's a book that might bring benefit to wider range of employees you can ask Maciej Z or Damian S to get it from company budget and add to our bookshelf.

After finishing reading of a book you bought from personal budget you can share it with others by dropping it on bookshelf (or google drive if it's ebook). Just remember to add new entry to spreadsheet :)
