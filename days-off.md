### Why we need rules regarding requesting days off

We need to stay healthy and well rested to be productive. HTD will always be taking into account the team needs regarding staying healthy and well rested.

Delivering software solutions requires teamwork. To deliver solutions on time we need to be acting effectively as a team. This includes coordinating days off so that we can be productive as a team and meet our obligations to clients.

When we sign a contract with a client we commit to delivering software on time. Our clients’ success depends on a timely delivery of solutions we work on. Unscheduled absence often puts projects at risk. Unscheduled absence, even if it does not put a project at risk, makes us look unprofessional and not organized well internally. This affects our reputation which is all we have and what we have worked hard to build. HTD is not office, desks or macbooks. It is our reputation.

### How to request days off internally?
When requesting days off use Calamari.

### Who will be responsible for my request?
Your request will land in your team lead's inbox. 

### What about my team?
You are almost always part of some team, and that team is not complete without you.
Team success depend on information flow.
Do not let the team find out about your absence on day zero.

### When should I inform my team?
- With planned absence, you should request days off at least 1 sprint earlier. If you plan to take more than 5 days off, you should request it at least 2 sprints earlier.
- Inform team on Slack and at the closest sprint planning prior to your absence when your request was accepted. That way team will be able to plan the sprint more accurately.
- Inform team on the closest standup and the slack after request will be accepted
- Inform team on the slack one week before your absence 
- Inform team on the slack one day before your absence

### What about conferences trip?
- Conferences are treated just like days off and time spent on them should be declared in the same way (whether for the team or client)

### When to request days off

We should notify a client as soon as possible but no later than:

| When requesting how many days off | Notify clients how much ahead |
| --------------------------------- | ----------------------------- |
| 1 day                             | 1 week before                 |
| 2 days                            | 2 weeks before                |
| 3 days                            | 3 weeks before                |
| 5 days                            | 5 weeks before                |
| >= 10 days                        | 10 weeks before               |

Letting a client know about an absence late does not give the client a warm fuzzy feeling.

There might be times where we need more strict rules than the ones above. In such a case this will be communicated to you ahead of time. An example of this is when HTD signs a project that is exceptionally time-critical e.g. when a release must be done before some conference (or otherwise the client loses a whole year) or simply a client made hard commitments themselves and consequently negotiated such terms in a contract with HTD.

### Emergency

In case of an emergency call your team leader (the phone number should be available in their profile on the slack ) or Wojtek Z (+48 600 420 660) or Maciek Z (+48 600 421 660).

### How to communicate days off to a client

Early :) A late news is a bad news.

Here are helpful phrases when communicating absence with client:
[Helpful English phrases](/helpful-english-phrases.md)

Always send a formal email to a client even though the client might have acknowledged on a call that is all fine. The formal email should be sent only after the client acknowledged the news told them on a call or sent over via Slack.
Create a calendar event right after you send the formal email and invite the client to the event.

### Who should communicate days off to a client
It depends on internal regulations in a team. 
Sometimes it will be your leader sometimes it will be you.

This point should be included in the Team Contract.

### Always use common sense

Whatever the rules are please always use common sense and be conscious. These are the questions that might help.

The phase of the project e.g. Are we about to ship a product we’ve worked on for a full year?
The relationship between the client and HTD e.g. Is this a brand new client that we’ve just started working for?
The time factor e.g. Is this the first week of working new client when we are in a trust building phase?

### What if more than one team member wants to take days off at the same time.

If a project does not allow for a simultaneous absence of more than one team member then we will apply first come first served rule and the request that was reported in Calamari later will be rejected.
