## Organizing and leading demo meetings

### Before a demo

- [ ] Make sure the features are deployed. Do not demo anything that is running on your local computer. Use a development / test / staging / UAT server instead.
- [ ] Make sure the features are merged to a main branch. Do not demo anything that is not yet merged.
- [ ] Make sure that a client you sent an invitation to has accepted the invitation.
- [ ] Book a conference room with a TV set and a mic.
- [ ] Prepare test data so that the features can be demoed efficiciently. 
- [ ] For the test data use English only and professional names. As an example, if you demo a doctor profile page then a doctor profile picture should be professional (not a random dude pic), the first and last names should be like-real names (not Candy Dandy). 
- [ ] For the test data use Grammarly to make sure that any texts are correct. You can install Grammarly browser extension.
- [ ] Prepare a demo agenda. Remember that a recipient of the demo (a client) might know less about the project details than you do. Therefore make sure you start with bullet points so that the recipient know what you present and are talking about and where the presented accomplishments fit in the big picture. Read about [the top down approach](https://medium.com/lessons-from-mckinsey/the-pyramid-principle-f0885dd3c5c7) and why and when it matters when communicating.
- [ ] Prep internally. Schedule a demo rehearsal and follow all the steps that will happen in a real demo meeting so that you have a full view what could go wrong during the meeting.
- [ ] When prepping ask one person to call in from another room. Let this person comment on audio and video quality, the demo flow and other demo parts afterwards.

### Just before a demo

- [ ] Everyone who will share a screen should have notifications turned off so that people do not see notification bubbles while they look at your screen.
- [ ] Everyone should either turn off notifications or turn off volume so that there is nothing interrupting during a demo
- [ ] Everyone should put their phones in a silent mode
- [ ] Turn on Zoom and make sure the camera settings are correct and audio quality are fine.

### Demo meeting playbook
- [ ] Say hello to everyone and explain the agenda.
- [ ] Mention a product mission and vision. The client needs to know we are aware what the big picture is.
- [ ] Speak slowly so that the client is able to process information and chime in if willing to do so.
- [ ] Start the demo with the sprint goal and present the accomplishments with [the top down approach](https://medium.com/lessons-from-mckinsey/the-pyramid-principle-f0885dd3c5c7)
- [ ] Pay attention to what is displayed on the screen. Do not let a mouse pointer wander randomly. 
- [ ] Ask for client feedback


### JIRA
User stories should be collapsed when you explain the sprint scope.

### Common mistakes
- [ ] Getting into details without explaining the big picture.
- [ ] Not making sure the camera settings are fine hence showing only a part of your face or a part of the team
- [ ] Saying "he" when you mean a user. Say "they" or "she". That's what they say in US. Instead of ~A user signs in and then he click the button.~ say "A user signs in and then they click the button."
- [ ] Interrupting another person, especially when they are from US. Remember, that interrupting anyone is considered rude in there. We should give others a lot of space and let them breathe and finish whatever sentence they are saying before chiming in. Be very cautious about it.
- [ ] Assuming that "OK" means "fine". "OK" does not mean either "good" nor "fine". "OK" most likely means that something is of subpar quality.
- [ ] Moving your mouse pointer around the screen with no clear goal while speaking. Remember your goal is to deliver your message in a concise way. 
- [ ] Being late. Don't let a client wait for you. Show that you respect their time.
- [ ] Receiving Slack notifications while sharing your screen. Protip: turn off any notification.
- [ ] Having too many tabs open and having your bookmarks visible when sharing your screen. Let a client focus on what's important and not wander about what you have in your bookmarks.
